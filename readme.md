# Documentation is under development
!!!

## Special Thanks

* **k1tty**, for her awesome documentation for D2Lua.
* **topIon**, for helping me with some networking questions.
* **DurtyFree**, for an expanded source of information about game content (https://forge.plebmasters.de/)
* **Antrix**, special thanks to the fact that after so many years of working on the menu and many problems, the w1tch project has not closed and continues to develop. Although this has nothing to do with documentation, if it weren’t for him, he wouldn’t exist.
