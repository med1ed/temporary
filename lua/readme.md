## Lua in Requiem

### What is a lua in RE
This is an addition to the menu, which are created by users themselves, they **can be both safe and very risky** to use, so when using lua scripts **you are responsible for the ban yourself and no one else**

## Lua Scripts
#### Available Lua scripts can be found on the [website](https://w1tch.net/files/category/6-lua/).

!!!
If you are a developer of any Lua script for RE and would like to have an extended description added, contact `med1ed` on discord or on the [website](https://w1tch.net/profile/45051-manager-ru/).

## Encrypt

RE also supports Lua script encryption, which will protect your Lua code and all the necessary files for your Lua.

1. Download this file [!file](/lua/LuaEncrypt.exe)
2. Open it and you will see the console
3. Move the file you need to the console (only in Lua format)
4. A file will be generated with the addition of `_encrypted` to the name
